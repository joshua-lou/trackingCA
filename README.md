# Updating the Indicator Data
Go to https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40 and download the excel file (if there is an excel file already in the `Tracking CA` folder, REPLACE IT so that there is only one excel fie left). Run `trackingCA.py` to update indicator data files. 

# Files to Put on Website
- index.html
- graphing.js
- style.css
- indicator-data.js

Note: Each time you update the indicator data, just replace `indicator-data.js`.
